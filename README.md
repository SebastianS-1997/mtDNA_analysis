# mtDNA Analysis Tool

This repository contains a Python script for analyzing mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants using various databases. The script performs several steps including data merging, filtering, and mapping of variants to loci.

## Overview

The provided Python script is designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Identify confirmed pathogenic variants using MITOMAP database.
2. Analyze variants with zero frequency in HelixMTdb database.
3. Match variants with predictions using MitImpact database.
4. Compare variants with gnomAD database.
6. Map variant positions to loci.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/mtDNA_analysis.git

### Additional Steps

1. Ensure that all necessary input files are included in the `Input` directory, and databases are stored in the `Database` directory.
2. If you have specific requirements or dependencies, make sure to include them in the installation instructions.
4. Consider adding a license file (`LICENSE`) to specify how others can use, modify, and distribute your code.
